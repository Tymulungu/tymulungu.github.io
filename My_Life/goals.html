              <h3>Long Term Goals</h3>
              <p>Graduate from Utah State University with a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science. Become a programmer. During school I want to have a web development job. After I graduate I want to get a job at a firm doing software development.  Married with kids. That is definitely a big goal of mine. I want to be a great husband and father. Also a spiritual goal is that I want to be active in church and magnify my church callings.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Short Term Goals</h3>
              <p>Work hard and get good at the job I have right now. Earn money and get good at budgeting that money so that I can save for school in either the summer or the fall. Also get good at coding. Like I said, first I want to get really good at html and css then maybe javascript then eventually I want to move more towards C++ or other software languages. I feel as though I am doing pretty good at this goal because this is my 3rd website that I've made and I have already learned and progressed so much!</p>
            </li><li>
              <h3>Random, No Time Period Goals</h3>
              <p>I have some sort of random goals too. Learn Ukulele and Guitar. Learn to Dance/take a dance class. Run/workout everyday. Keep social media and other unimportant distractions low.</p>
